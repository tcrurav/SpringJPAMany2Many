# Spring CRUD RESTFul with Basic example of Many to Many Relationship

It's just that... A simple project to demonstrate the use of Spring in a basic example with a Many to Many Relationship.

## Getting Started

For the initial steps give a try to my following video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvzGf0cAlg4

It's a step by step guide to understand how to make a Spring project implementing RESTFul and JPA accessing MySQL.

For the theory envolving Many-to-many relationships in Spring I recommend you:
https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-many-to-many

After that clone this project and try it.

The Database is here:

### Prerequisites

All you need is... some time and...
* Eclipse IDE.
* STS 4, installed through the Eclipse Marketplace.
* MySQL Workbench, to host the database also included in the project.
* PostMan, for the RESTFul tests.
* More hours than you first could think of...
